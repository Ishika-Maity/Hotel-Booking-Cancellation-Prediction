# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled based on various features such as booking details, customer information, and historical booking data. The goal is to help hotel managers better understand booking behavior and optimize their operations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features, such as:
- Customer information (e.g., nationality, age)
- Booking details (e.g., lead time, room type)
- Historical booking data (e.g., cancellation status, number of adults)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ishika-Maity/Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model development (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated on the test data to predict booking cancellations. Further improvements can be made by tuning the model or using more complex algorithms.
